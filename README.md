The Mathematics Admissions Test (MAT) is a subject-specific admissions test, lasting 2 hours and 30 minutes and sat under timed conditions. The MAT is a hybrid test - with computer-based questions and a paper answer booklet. You will need to take this test at an authorised test centre which, in most cases, will be your school or college. All applicants taking this test will be able to practise by taking the 2022 past paper (or equivalent) as a hybrid test in advance of your test day. Please note that as the structure of this test has not changed, all the existing resources and [past papers](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/guide/admissions-tests/mat#content-tab--5) available here are still valuable preparation for you and we strongly recommend exploring these. 

The MAT is designed to be approachable for all students, including those without Further Mathematics A-level or equivalent. It aims to test the depth of mathematical understanding of a student rather than a breadth of knowledge. The mathematical knowledge and techniques required to do the questions are taken from a syllabus roughly corresponding to AS-level Maths, with a few extra topics from A-level Maths. If you're unsure what this covers, you can find the full MAT syllabus on the practice materials tab on this page.

Which questions you answer in the test depends on the course you are applying for. Details of precisely which questions you should attempt are given below. (Don't worry, you can also find these details in the instructions throughout the test.)



+ Mathematics, Mathematics and Statistics, and Mathematics and Philosophy applicants should attempt questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
+ Mathematics and Computer Science, Computer Science, and Computer Science and Philosophy applicants should attempt questions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
+ Oxford applicants who are also applying to courses at Imperial College London and/or the University of Warwick should attempt the questions required by the Oxford course they are applying for.

The first question on the test is multiple choice and contains ten parts, each worth four marks. Marks are given solely for the correct answers, though you are encouraged to show any working out. Questions 2–6 are longer questions, each worth 15 marks, and again, you will need to show your working. Part marks are available for the longer questions. You should attempt four questions from 2–6, the selection depending on the degree for which you are applying as above.
